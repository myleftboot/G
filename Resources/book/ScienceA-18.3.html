	<h2 id="link1">Paying for electricity</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Energy from the mains supply is measured in <strong>kilowatt-hours</strong> (<strong>kWh</strong>) (<em>see</em> Section 18.2). Each unit of electricity is 1&nbsp;kWh.</li>
        <li>The kilowatt-hours (units) used is recorded by an <strong>electricity meter</strong>.</li>
        <li>Energy companies charge for each kilowatt-hour used. Total cost = number of kWh used × cost per kWh.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>energy used	= 46&nbsp;800 – 45&nbsp;300
            <br/>= 1500&nbsp;kWh
            <br/>cost = 1500 × 14p	= 21&nbsp;000p 
            <br/>= £210
            <br/>
            <br/>The cost of the energy used is £210.

            <br/>
            </li>     
         <li>The cost of running an appliance can be worked out from its power in kilowatts, the time it is switched on in hours, and the cost per kilowatt-hour.
cost (p) = power (kW) × time (h) × cost per kWh (p/kWh)

        <br/>

	<ul>
		  <li>An electrical device that is more <strong>efficient</strong> transfers more electrical energy to useful energy (<em>see</em> Section <FONT COLOR="D2320A">17.X). [refers to AQA P1.2]</FONT></li>
          <li>A more efficient device costs less to run for the same amount of useful energy.</li>   
          <li>Old-style filament light bulbs waste energy by getting hot. They are being replaced by more efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps.</li>

	<h2 id="link3">Payback time and cost efficiency (AQA, Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
             <li>Choosing a more efficient electrical device saves on energy costs. But the initial cost of buying it may be high.</li>
        <li><strong>Payback time</strong> is the length of time it takes to save the money it costs to buy the item. 
        <br/>
        <br/><strong><FONT COLOR="DE4000">Example</FONT></strong>
            <br/><em>You decide to replace a broken GU10 bulb with a CFL bulb (£6.75) that will save 24p each week compared with a halogen bulb (£1.95). What is the payback time?</em>
            <br/>
            <br/>greater cost of CFL = £6.75 – £1.95
            <br/>= £4.80
            <br/>saving per week = 24p
            <br/>payback time = 480 ÷ 24 = 20&nbsp;weeks
            <br/>
            <br/>The payback time is 20&nbsp;weeks.
            <br/>
            <br/>
       </li>     
        <li>Energy can be saved in the home by using low-energy devices, and also by insulating the home. The most <strong>cost efficient</strong>, or <strong>cost effective</strong>, method is the one that saves the most money compared with its cost in the shortest time.

            <br/>Which of the two methods of insulation is the more cost effective?</em>
            <br/>
            <br/>compare payback times:
            <br/>cavity wall insulation
            <br/>350 ÷ 100 = 3.5&nbsp;years
            <br/>loft insulation
            <br/>200 ÷ 150 = 1.33&nbsp;years
            <br/>
            <br/>Loft insulation is more cost effective.

    <h2 id="link4">Choosing appliances (AQA, Edexcel)</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Factors to consider when choosing an electrical appliance:
            <ul>
            what you need it to do</li>
                <li>how well it does the job required</li>
                <li>purchase cost</li>
                <li>running costs (energy use, repairs)</li>
                <li>environmental costs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Energy-saving products have both advantages and disadvantages:
            <ul>
                     <li>a CFL lamp uses less energy than a filament lamp, but is more expensive to buy and takes some time to reach full brightness.</li>
                    <li>a microwave oven uses less energy than a conventional oven but cannot make food crisp and brown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Electrical appliances have energy ratings from A++ (most efficient) to G (least efficient). Fridges, freezers, washing machines and dishwashers have A+++ as the highest rating.
