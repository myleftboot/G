	<h2 id="link1">Sources of metals</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Metals are essential to everyday life: we use aluminium to make airplane bodies, copper to make piping, and steel to make bridges and cooking utensils, to name a few.
            <figure>

				<figcaption><em>The Bronze Age (from c.3500 BC) was the first period of large-scale metal extraction. Copper mixed with tin made an <strong>alloy</strong>, bronze. This was used to make durable items like jewellery, armour, and this Ancient Egyptian cat</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>		  
            
        <li>All of these metals are found naturally – in the Earth’s crust – but usually not in their pure form. They exist as <strong>ores</strong>: rocks that contain compounds of these metals. Millions of tonnes of rock are mined each year, because the pure metal contained in each tonne is only a small percentage.</li>
        
        <li>If a metal is: (a) sufficiently useful to us; (b) found in large enough quantities; (c) not too difficult to separate from its ore, <strong>extracting</strong> it becomes worthwhile. It is mined and processed to make the pure metal.</li>
        
        <li>Some metals are highly unreactive with other elements – e.g. silver, gold, platinum – and are found in their <strong>native state</strong>: the pure metal is mixed up in the rock; it is not found in compounds.

            </figure>
        </li>
        
        <li>Some presently uneconomical ores might be extracted profitably in the future if new methods are discovered for their extraction. The financial viability of metal extraction may therefore change over time: scientific research and discovery continues.</li>
                
                    
    </ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Extraction of metals</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>There are different methods of extracting metals; these depend on the metal’s position in the <strong>reactivity series</strong>:
            <figure>

                <figcaption><em>The reactivity series</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
         </li>
         
         <li>The more reactive a metal is, the harder it will be to extract: it will form many compounds. Highly reactive metals like potassium and sodium are extracted by electrolysis (<em>see</em> below). This is an expensive process using plenty of electricity.</li>
         
         <li>The less reactive a metal is, the easier it will be to extract, e.g. gold or platinum. But that does not necessarily mean it will be economical to extract. It depends on how deep underground it is, in what quantities it can be found, and what price can be obtained for it.</li>
         
         <li><strong>Carbon, a non-metal, is often used to extract some metals</strong>. It reacts well when heated with common metal ores such as iron(III) oxide, tin oxide and lead oxide. This only works if carbon is more reactive than the metal – otherwise it is unable to displace oxygen in the metal’s oxide:
            <br/>
            <br/><strong><FONT COLOR="D2320A">Generally</FONT></strong>
            <br/>metal oxide + carbon + <FONT COLOR="D2320A">HEAT</FONT> &rArr;
            <br/>metal + carbon dioxide
            <br/>
            <br/><strong><FONT COLOR="D2320A">Example</FONT></strong>
            <br/>iron(III) oxide + carbon + <FONT COLOR="D2320A">HEAT</FONT> &rArr;
            <br/>iron + carbon dioxide
            <br/>
            <br/>2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> +3C &rArr; 4Fe  +  3CO<sub>2</sub>
            <br/>
            <br/>This type of reaction is called <strong>reduction</strong>: it removes oxygen.
            <br/>
         </li>
         
         <li>If a metal is more reactive than carbon, it needs to be extracted using <strong>electrolysis</strong>. Carbon’s <em>relative</em> lack of reactivity (in this case) would not allow it to react with the metal substance and combine with the oxygen in the substance.</li>

                                                                     
        
	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Oxidation and reduction (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
          <li>The removal of oxygen from a compound is called <strong>reduction</strong>. In the example above, the metal oxide has ‘been reduced’. The opposite reaction – combining a metal with oxygen – is called <strong>oxidation</strong>.</li>
          
          <li>Changes to the surface of a metal from its reaction with oxygen are called <strong>corrosion</strong>, a form of oxidation (<em>see</em> e.g. sodium exposed to air, Section 9.1). The corrosion of iron specifically – and alloys of it like steel – is called <strong>rusting</strong>.

				<figcaption><em>The iron ‘Angel of the North’ statue near Gateshead soon oxidised and now has a coating of iron(III) oxide – rust</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        
        <li>Generally, the more reactive a metal is, the more it will corrode. Platinum and gold never corrode, this is one of the reasons they are called ‘precious’ metals. Aluminium only corrodes slightly: its oxidised outer layer protects the inner layer, rather than corroding further.</li>
