	<h2 id="link1">Effects of environmental change</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>The habitats of plants, animals and microbes across the world are all subject to the possibility of environmental change. New competitors may appear, looking for territory or putting down roots; new pathogens may mutate; long-term climate change – e.g. increased average temperature or reduced rainfall – may alter local habitats.</li>
        <li>These unexpected forces of change - which are either living or non-living - may have specific effects on the <strong>distribution and behaviour</strong> of indigenous plants, animals and microbes in a certain habitat.

            </figure>
        </li> 
         <li>The eucalyptus tree is mostly native to Australia, where it is home to the Koala bear. But it is also an <strong>invasive species</strong> in Europe and North America, where it is used to make wood pulp for papermaking. Planting eucalyptus trees in these new places is a man-&nbsp;made environmental change.</li>  
        <li>Where eucalyptus trees replace native oak trees, squirrels – some of which mostly feed on acorns – may move to other areas in search of new oaks. Or, their diets may alter: they may be forced to eat supplementary foods such as seeds, cones and berries.

            </figure>
         </li>
         <li>Typically, environmental change on Earth has been very slow, but almost continuous nevertheless, over thousands or millions of years. These slow changes may give animals and plants time to evolve and adapt to the new circumstances (<em>see</em> Section <FONT COLOR="D2320A">X.X</FONT>).</li>
    </ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Measuring environmental change</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>Measuring environmental change is important to minimising man-made threats to the environment, such as pollution. Typical measurements that are taken include soil acidity, temperature changes in a particular place over a long time, and O<sub>2</sub> levels.</li>               
         <li>We can also measure pollution using living things. If species that adapt well to polluted environments are present in a particular place – and flourishing while others are to be absent – this is evidence of pollution.</li>
         <li>These types of creatures are called <strong>indicator species</strong>. One such species is lichens, which are highly sensitive to air pollution, especially the presence of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).

				<figcaption><em>Lichens are found throughout the UK: here they are dotted all over the large stone</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
         </li>
        <li>They have no roots, so their main source of nutrients is the air. They grow well and in wide varieties in clean air. Experts also know which species are most susceptible to air pollution and which resist it best.</li>
         <li>Some animals are also strong indicators of water pollution. If water is clean, the number of <strong>invertebrates</strong> found there is likely to be higher. Invertebrates are animals that have no backbone. Many live in streams and ponds and are easy to collect.</li>
         <li>Invertebrates have varying degrees of tolerance to pollutants. The presence (or not) of different species with differing tolerances is a measure of pollution in one place. For example, the freshwater shrimp and stonefly nymph only live in clean water; the rat-tailed maggot and sludgeworm can live in polluted water.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Eutrophication</strong> (Edexcel):
        <br/>Eutrophication is part of the nitrogen cycle (<em>see</em> Section <FONT COLOR="D2320A">X.X</FONT>). Nitrates and phosphates used by farmers as fertilisers can pollute when heavy rain washes them down into rivers.</li> 
        <li>Algae feed on these chemicals and grow rapidly, covering the surface and blocking out light. This may kill plants under the surface that rely on photosynthesis. Bacteria that feed on dead plants rapidly multiply and use up oxygen, threatening fish species.
