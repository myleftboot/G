	<h2 id="link1">Acid indigestion (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Stomach acid kills bacteria and helps digestive enzymes break down food.</li>
        <li>But excess stomach acid (HCl) causes <strong>indigestion</strong>, which in turn can cause “heartburn” if the acid moves up the oesophagus towards the mouth.</li>
        <li>Medicines (antacids) can relieve indigestion by neutralising the acid. These medicines contain <strong>bases</strong>: <br>compounds that react with acids. If a base is soluble it is called an <strong>alkali</strong>.</br></li>
        <li>Medicines are expensive, yet are sometimes similar to other common chemicals found in the home, e.g. baking powder, a carbonate that neutralises acids. Some people use these alternative remedies instead.</li>
       
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Neutralisation of acids</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The only substances that can neutralise acids are metal carbonates, metal oxides and metal hydroxides. These substances are alkalis:
            <br/>
        <br/>acid + metal carbonate &rArr;
        <br/>salt + water + carbon dioxide
            <br/>
        <br/>acid + metal oxide &rArr; salt + water
            <br/>
        <br/>acid + metal hydroxide &rArr;
        <br>salt + water
            <br/>
        <br/><strong><FONT COLOR="D2320A">Examples</FONT></strong>
        <br/>CuCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2HCl(aq) &rArr;
        <br/>CuCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)
            <br/>
        <br/>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + CuO(s) &rArr;
        <br/>CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)
            <br/>
        <br/>HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + NaOH(s) &rArr;
        <br/>NaNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)
        <br/>
        <br/><strong>Salts</strong> are produced in each case. The salt produced depends on the acid:

        </li>
        <li>Edexcel: pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity. On the pH scale, 0 is most acid, 14 is most alkaline.

			</figure></li>
        <li>Edexcel: A universal indicator such as damp Litmus paper can be used to test pH. Red Litmus turns blue in alkaline conditions; blue Litmus turns red in acidic conditions.</li>
        <li>Edexcel: Alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, and also acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid, can be corrosive and therefore dangerous. We use <strong>hazard symbols</strong> to identify and warn about such chemicals:

        </li>
	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Uses and abuses of alkalis (OCR)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Even before the industrial revolution, alkalis were used:
            <ul>
                <li>to neutralise acids in soils</li>
                <li>to make glass</li>
                <li>to make soap from fats/oils</li>
                <li>to make alum, a chemical that fixes dyes to cloth.</li>
            </ul>
</li>
        <li>The alum manufacturing process created a very acidic solution. Natural alkalis like burnt wood ash or human urine were used as neutralisers.</li>
        <li>As Britain and neighbours like France industrialised in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, new sources of alkalis were needed for the expanding soap and glass industries. The Frenchman Nicolas Leblanc invented a process to make sodium carbonate from chalk/limestone, common salt (NaCl) and coal.</li>
        <li>However, the <strong>Leblanc process</strong> was highly polluting, releasing huge amounts of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl), making nearby land overly acidic, and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) with its overpowering smell.

		</figure></li>
        <li>The industry was eventually regulated by law. Acts of Parliament were passed and inspectors began to check how much acid was being released by industrial chimneys.</li>
        <li>Later in the century a process was invented to produce chlorine by mixing HCl gas with oxygen. Chlorine has different properties from hydrogen chloride (<em>see</em> Electrolysis, Section 10.3). A waste product had been converted into a useful chemical.</li>
