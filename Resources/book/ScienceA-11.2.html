	<h2 id="link1">Extraction and uses of iron</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Iron ores such as <strong>haematite</strong> (<em>see</em> Section 9.1) are rich in iron oxide and are extracted using the carbon heating method, in a <strong>blast furnace</strong>. This iron is about 96&nbsp;percent pure.</li>
        
        <li>Its 4&nbsp;percent impurities make it brittle: it only has limited uses, e.g. to make moulded <strong>cast iron</strong>  objects like engine parts (e.g. cylinder block) and arched supports on short bridges.

            </figure>
        </li>
        
        <li>Further purification of this cast iron could result in pure iron, which is highly <strong>malleable</strong> – soft and easily shaped. In fact, it is too malleable. To strengthen it for our use it is mainly mixed with varying percentages of carbon, and sometimes metals like tungsten, nickel, and chromium.</li>
        
        <li>These mixes make <strong>alloys</strong> of iron called <strong>steels</strong>. The most common is carbon steel, which is iron mixed with carbon at roughly 0.1–1.5%, to make different grades of steel. These steels are all around us: car bodies, washing machines, steel-framed buildings.</li>
        
        <li>Other steels include:
            <ul>
                <li>chromium/nickel steels, which are resistant to corrosion (e.g. <strong>stainless steel</strong> cutlery);</li>
                <li><strong>low-carbon steels</strong>, which are easily shaped and used to make e.g. car body panels;</li>
                <li><strong>high-carbon steels</strong>, which are harder and used to make e.g. steel-framed buildings and suspension bridges. To stop these steels rusting, they are painted, often repeatedly.</li>
             </ul>   
            <figure>

    </ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Extraction and uses of aluminium</h2>
	<ul>
		  
         <li>Aluminium (Al) is a common and versatile metal with many positive properties:
            <ul>
                <li>it is especially light for a metal – it has a low density;</li>
                <li>it does not corrode (recall the thin layer of aluminium oxide mentioned in Section 11.1);</li>
                <li>it is highly malleable in its purest form, yet its alloys can be very strong.</li>
             </ul>                
          </li>                            
                                                    
          <li>For example, one alloy of aluminium is very malleable yet strong enough for short-term everyday use: in soft drink cans. These cans can easily be crushed and recycled after use; aluminium is highly recycleable.
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/11.2.3-1024px-149405.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>Some aluminium alloys are sufficiently soft and flexible to fold into large rolls for transportation to manufacturers</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
         </li>
        
         <li>The lightness <em>and</em> strength of other aluminium alloys gives them advantages over iron/steel for making things that must be both light and strong, such as cooking utensils, bicycles, power lines, cars.</li>
                                                                                                                                                     
        <li>Perhaps the most obvious everyday use of aluminium alloys is in aircraft. Aircraft bodies need to be as light as possible so that the plane can take off, but strong enough to resist very force winds while in the air:
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/11.2.4-1280px-A380_F-WWEA_LEGT.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>The Airbus A380 is the world’s largest passenger jet. Parts of it are made from a special composite alloy of aluminium and fibreglass – a strong, light, fire-resistant, corrosion-free material</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Aluminium extraction</strong>: Aluminium is more reactive than carbon: so carbon cannot extract it. Electrolysis is used instead, but first the aluminium oxide needs to be melted. Aluminium extraction is a multi-stage process. The molten aluminium oxide is then electrolysed at high temperatures.</li>
                                                                                                                
         <li>The process is expensive: melting requires a lot of energy, then the electricity used in electrolysis adds to the cost. And the aluminium ore needs to be mined in the first place. However, aluminium is so useful that the expense is worthwhile.</li>                                                                                     
        
	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Extraction and uses of titanium</h2>
	<ul>
         <li>The properties of titanium are similar to those of aluminium: it is strong, light (though aluminium is lighter) and resists corrosion because of its slight outer oxide layer. It is commonly used in hip replacement joints because of these properties.
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/11.2.5-A380-trent900.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>A titanium alloy is used to make the intake fan blades of modern jet engines. They need to be very strong so that they do not fracture – birds sometimes fly into them. They must also be very heat resistant. Titanium has a high melting point, so is ideal for the job</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Titanium extraction</strong>: Titanium oxide can be heated with carbon, but the resulting titanium carbide is brittle. Titanium is produced using a complex and expensive process of electrolysis, involving multiple steps and lots of energy. Titanium is therefore even more expensive than aluminium. </li>
        
                        
    </ul>
	
    <h2 id="link4">Extraction and uses of copper</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Copper (Cu) is a <strong>transition metal</strong> (<em>see</em> Appendix 1: The Periodic Table), as are iron (Fe) and titanium (Ti). These metals are typically very good conductors of heat and electricity, and are malleable yet strong.</li>
        
         <li>Copper is malleable, but is strengthened when alloyed with tin (for example) to make bronze. It is very unreactive: just above silver and gold in the reactivity series. Water – which like oxygen can oxidise metals – does not react with copper, hence copper’s use in piping.
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/11.2.6-Stranded_lamp_wire.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>Copper’s main use is in electric wiring because it is <strong>ductile</strong> (stretchable) and an excellent electrical conductor. For best conductivity the copper must be pure</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
         </li>
         
         <li><strong>Copper extraction</strong> (<strong>AQA</strong>): Copper is extracted from its ores, such as malachite and chalcocite. Typically it comes from open-cast mines. There are several ways of extracting copper, all of which use plenty of energy. </li>
         
         <li>For example, a copper ore such as malachite or chalcocite is first <strong>concentrated</strong> as much as possible: separated from other rocks that have been mined with it.</li>
         
         <li>It may then be <strong>smelted</strong>(heated) in a furnace. The copper compound reacts with oxygen in the air. Smelting requires plenty of heat energy: 
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>Smelting of malachite</strong>
            <br/>copper carbonate + oxygen &rArr;
            <br/>copper oxide + carbon dioxide
            <br/>
            <br/><em>(the copper oxide can then be reduced by heating with carbon)</em>
            <br/>
            <br/><strong>Smelting of chalcocite</strong>
            <br/>copper(I) sulfide + oxygen &rArr;
            <br/>copper + sulfur dioxide
            <br/>
         </li>
         
         <li>Another copper extraction technique is via <strong>displacement</strong> – adding scrap iron to a solution of copper salts: 
            <br/>
            <br/>e.g. iron + copper sulfate &rArr;
            <br/>iron sulfate + copper
            <br/>
            <br/>Copper purification – e.g. for making wiring – can be carried out using electrolysis. 
            <br/>

    </ul>
