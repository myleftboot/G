	<h2 id="link1">Health effects of smoking (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Smoking for pleasure took off in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, especially the 1920s, when it was even advertised as a sophisticated and classy activity:

        </li>
        <li>We now know from scientific evidence that smoking is extremely unhealthy. Estimates suggest that more than <br/>40&nbsp;000 people in the UK die each year from smoking-related cancers</li>
        <li>Cigarettes contain sticky <strong>tars</strong> that coat the lungs with <strong>carcinogenic</strong> (cancer producing) chemicals. Cigarette tars also damage the gums and taste buds in the mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Nicotine</strong> is another chemical present in cigarettes. It is addictive, and contributes strongly to the difficulties smokers have giving up their habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbon monoxide</strong> too is present in cigarette smoke. It is a poisonous gas that reduces the oxygen that can be carried by the circulatory system’s red blood cells to cells in the body. It also narrows blood vessels: a similar effect to that of bad cholesterol.</li>
        <li>These chemicals enter the lungs with every single puff of a cigarette. Their damaging effects on the body build up over time. Quitting smoking even late in life can increase your lifespan.</li>
    
    </ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Evidence of the effects (Edexcel, OCR)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Before the 1920s few people developed lung cancer. Cases of this and other cancers began to increase dramatically during the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
        <li>Governments began to notice that there seemed to be a correlation between smoking and lung cancer:

            </figure>
        </li>
        <li>However, despite the apparent evidence of this type of graph, a specific cause-and-effect needed to be identified to show that smoking really does cause lung cancer. The proof of this needed to be scientific.</li>
        <li>For many years, tobacco companies argued strongly that cigarettes do not adversely affect a smoker’s health. They wanted to protect their income and profits, and tried to suggest that other factors, like pollution in general, may be causing these new cancers.</li>
        <li>Eventually scientists were able to work out how the tars in cigarettes cause cancers: they found the specific microscopic mechanisms involved. This was the scientific proof that smoking does indeed cause cancer.

        </li>
        <li>Lung cancer and heart disease (<em>see</em> Section 3.3) are for the most part regarded as preventable <strong>lifestyle diseases</strong>; they are not infectious diseases (<em>see</em> Section 1.3).</li>
        
        
	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">The ethics of transplants (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Sometimes, alcoholics are given liver transplants on the NHS, and obese people or smokers may be given a new heart. The decision is first medical (are the donor’s and the patient’s tissues similar? how ill is the patient?), but it is also an <strong>ethical</strong> one.</li>
        <li>Heart disease and liver disease can often be almost entirely self-inflicted. If you were a <strong>donor</strong>, willing to give up your organs if you were to die in an accident, would you be happy for an alcoholic to benefit from this?</li>
        <li>What if the person proved they could stay off alcohol for many months? Should they get a ‘second chance’? Hospitals are faced with difficult ethical dilemmas like this when deciding who should benefit from organ <strong>transplants</strong>, not least because the waiting lists for these are long.</li>
                
    </ul>
