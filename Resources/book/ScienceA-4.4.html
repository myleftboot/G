	<h2 id="link1">Extremophiles (AQA)</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>Organisms that have extreme adaptations are called <strong>extremophiles</strong>. For example, at low temperatures the giant groundsel (<em>see</em> Section 4.1) produces an anti-freeze type chemical: this stops water in its cells from freezing and damaging the cells. </li>
         <li>Extreme characteristics are often found in simple organisms like bacteria: these characteristics take less evolutionary time to develop (<em>see</em> Section <FONT COLOR="D2320A">X.X</FONT>) than they would in complex organisms.

        <li><strong>Pompeii worms</strong> live near deep ocean vents thousands of metres under the sea. These vents release mineral-rich water at temperatures of 80°C or more. The water pressure at this depth can be 100&nbsp;times that of the surface.</li>
        <li>The bacteria that Pompeii worms feed on use <strong>chemosynthesis</strong> to obtain nutrients from the vents. They have a mechanism that converts chemicals like hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into simple carbohydrates, a basic food.

	<h2 id="link2">Parasitism and mutualism (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
		   <li>Some animals, plants and microorganisms live close to each other because one or both of them use the other to survive. The relationships can work in a variety ways, e.g. between animals and animals, animals and plants, microbes and animals, etc.</li>
           <li>A <strong>parasitic</strong> relationship is where one organism benefits from another ‘host’ organism – often obtaining food – and in some way <em>harms</em> the host. For example, <strong>human head lice and tapeworms</strong> may live on us or in us (respectively), and are harmful: we function better without them</li>
            <li>The parasitic relationship only benefits the parasite. For example, <strong>mistletoe</strong> grows on host trees, obtaining nutrients and water from them by inserting a special root into the host’s branches. The host gets nothing in return, and may even die.
                <figure><img src="assets/images/4.4.3-1024px-Mistletoe_P1210829.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>A parasite is clearly distinguishable in this picture: it is mistletoe, which looks nothing like the host tree’s flowers</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>In <strong>mutualism</strong> the relationship benefits both organisms. For example, oxpeckers feed on the blood-sucking insects that live on many African animals. This is food for the oxpecker and is useful to the animal; its skin is damaged by the insect parasites.
                <figure><img src="assets/images/4.4.4-Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Imbabala_Bushbuck_Tragelaphus_sylvaticus.jpg" alt="" >
				<figcaption><em>A bushbuck antelope with its attendant red-billed oxpeckers. Another name for mutualism is <strong>symbiosis</strong></em></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li> 
             <li>Another example of a mutually beneficial relationship is between <strong>nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plants</strong> such as peas, beans and soy. The bacteria live inside the legume’s roots.</li>
              <li>In this case the relationship is more than just ‘useful’ – it is essential to the survival of both organisms. The plant provides the bacteria with food; the bacteria provides the plant with nitrogen compounds, which are essential for the plant’s growth.</li>
