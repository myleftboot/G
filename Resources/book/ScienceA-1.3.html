	<h2 id="link1">Defining ‘bacteria’ and ‘virus’</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Pathogens</strong> are microorganisms (also called microbes) that cause disease. Bacteria and viruses are types of pathogens. (Edexcel/OCR: Fungi such as athlete’s foot are also pathogens.)</li>
        <li><strong>Bacteria</strong> are tiny single-celled organisms. Some are harmful, some are harmless and some are even useful, e.g. for making dairy foods and medicines.</li>
        <li><strong>Viruses</strong> are smaller than bacteria and are often simply shaped, e.g. rods or spheres. They are so small that they can even cause diseases in bacteria.

            </li>
              
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Disease and its causes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Diseases are abnormal conditions affecting the body. They can be infectious or inherited. They can be common and mild (e.g. a cold) or less common and serious (e.g. smallpox).</li>
        <li>Infectious disease occurs when pathogens in our environment get into the body. They are called <strong>infectious</strong> because they can spread.</li>
        <li>Infectious diseases spread in different ways, e.g. contaminated food/drink in the stomach; droplets in the air inhaled from someone sneezing/coughing; directly into the blood via wounds; by <strong>vectors</strong> such as mosquitos; in body fluids (e.g. HIV).</li>
        <li>Bacteria and viruses reproduce quickly inside the body. Viruses attack cells in the body, destroying them. Bacteria multiply by dividing in two, often producing poisons (<strong>toxins</strong>) that make us feel ill. These feelings are the symptoms of illness.</li>

	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Defence against microbes</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Our skin, and the scabs that form when we cut ourselves, are the outermost natural protection against pathogens entering our body.</li>
        <li>The mucus in our nose and throat traps pathogens from the air, as do <strong>lysozymes</strong> in our tears; the acid in our stomachs kills pathogens in our food and drink.</li>
        <li>The Hungarian doctor <strong>Ignaz Semmelweiss</strong> was one of the first to recommend simple hand-washing to stop viruses and bacteria being spread in hospitals (by doctors treating different patients).</li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h2 id="link4">White blood cells protect us</h2>
	<ul>
		
        <li>Inside our bodies, a key defence against disease is our white blood cells. They are part of our <strong>immune system</strong>:
        <figure>

        </figure></li>
        <li><strong>Antigens</strong> are markers on the outside of a microbe. These markers are unique to that pathogen; specific white blood cells in our bodies create specific <strong>antibodies</strong> for specific pathogens. There are three ways that red blood cells kill pathogens:
        <figure>

        </figure></li>
         <li>OCR: <strong>Memory cells</strong> are white blood cells that defend against a second infection by a pathogen; they act more quickly the second time around.</li>
         <li>OCR: Viruses mutate very quickly; their antigens change, which is why we can catch a common illness like the flu multiple times.</li>
         <li>OCR: In a wound, redness, swelling and pus are positive signs of dead bacteria and used white blood cells: our immune system is working well.</li>
           </ul>
