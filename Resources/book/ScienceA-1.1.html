	<h2 id="link1">A healthy diet (AQA)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A healthy diet contains minerals, vitamins, fibre, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and water.</li> 
        <li>Together these provide a balanced diet, giving energy, building new cells, protecting us against disease.</li> 
        <li>An unbalanced diet results in malnourishment, which may lead to illness, e.g. deficiency diseases, which are caused by lack of minerals and vitamins.

	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">Our energy needs vary (AQA)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Food gives us energy to live and move. The more exercise we do, the more food we need (and vice versa).</li>
        <li>Our energy needs vary according to our age, sex, location. We generally need more energy if we are young, or pregnant, or live in a cold climate.</li>
        <li>Muscle burns more energy than fat. Exercise gives us more muscle mass; athletes therefore need more energy.</li>
        <li>Exercise is not always athletic; vigorous household chores and walking are also exercise.</li>
	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Our metabolic rates vary (AQA)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Metabolic rate is the rate at which chemical reactions occur in cells of the body.</li>
        <li>Metabolic rate increases with exercise, and in colder climates, and with higher muscle content in the body.</li>
        <li>Two people who do the same amount of exercise and are the same sex, age, and weight may have different metabolic rates: their metabolic rate is partly inherited from their parents.</li>
        <li>Men usually have a higher metabolic rate than women because they usually have proportionately more muscle than fat.</li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h2 id="link4">Our weight (AQA)</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>If our food gives us more energy than we use, the extra energy is stored in our bodies as fat. We can become overweight, or even obese.</li>
        <li>Being overweight increases our risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis and type 2 diabetes (excessively high blood sugar levels).</li>
        <li>However, some fat is essential to a balanced diet: it is a store of energy for ‘emergency’ use and cushions our organs.</li>
        <li>We can look slimmer by exercising more and through slimming regimes.</li>
        <li>‘Slimming’ and ‘losing weight’ - exercise may help us to slim, at the same time our weight may not change much: exercise builds muscle; muscle weighs more than fat.</li>
        <li>In some parts of the world drought, war and pests mean that people’s food gives them less energy than they need, and/or less food of the right type, leading to malnourishment.</li>
		<li><strong>Malnourishment</strong> can mean both eating too much and eating too little (of the right foods at the right amount). The term ‘weight problem’ therefore has two meanings.

    </ul>
	
    
    <h2 id="link5">Diabetes (Edexcel)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Diabetes is a disease where the sufferer has difficulty controlling their blood glucose levels. This is caused by a lack of <strong>insulin</strong>, an important hormone in the blood.</li>
        <li>High blood glucose can cause abnormal urination, thirst and tiredness.</li>
        <li>Type 1 diabetes can be controlled by injections of insulin into the sufferer’s subcutaneous fat: the fat easily absorbs insulin and moves it into the patient’s blood.</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed when a patient’s cells are less responsive to insulin than they should be (more resistant to it), even if insulin is being produced (this occurs in the pancreas).</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes is thought to be caused by modern lifestyles - high fat diets, lack of exercise, <strong>obesity</strong>- and by ageing. It is usually characterised by high blood glucose levels.</li>
        <li>A person is obese when their <strong>Body Mass Index</strong>(BMI) is over 30:
           <br/>
           <p align="center">weight (kg)
           <br/>BMI =   <sup> __________________   </sup>
           <br/>        height<sup>2</sup> (m)
           </p>
            </li>
		<li>Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes can be partly controlled through diet and physical exercise/activity. Exercise reduces the amount of insulin a person needs to control their blood sugar levels.</li>        
    </ul>
