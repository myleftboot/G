	<h2 id="link1">Energy sources</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>The energy we use in everyday life comes from a number of different original sources. These sources are either renewable or non-renewable (sustainable or unsustainable energy).</li>
         <li>A renewable energy source is one that is replenished by nature. These include: solar energy; hydroelectric energy; tidal, wave and wind energy; geothermal energy, biofuels. They are all <strong>primary energy sources</strong> because they are natural.

            </figure>
        </li>
        <li>A non-renewable energy source is one that may run out if used over a long period of time. This energy comes from minerals, e.g. uranium and plutonium, and <strong>fossil fuels</strong> such as coal, petroleum/oil, natural gas.</li>

        <li><strong>Carbon capture</strong>: A new development. CO<sub>2</sub> could be captured in power stations before it escapes into the atmosphere; it may then be pumped into depleted underground oil/gas chambers to seal it safely away. </li>

	<h2 id="link2">Generating electricity</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>There are several types of electricity generating power stations; these often use turbines to power generators. Our core energy demands still rely on these traditional stations, which use fossil fuels to produce steam to drive the turbines.

				<figcaption><em>General diagram of a fossil fuel power station. Note that power stations cannot be 100% efficient: they lose energy as heat in the cooling tower and gas stack</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wind and wave power</strong>: Wind turbines are driven directly by the flow of air on the blades; the up and down movement of waves can turn a generator in a buoyancy chamber.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydroelectric and tidal power</strong>: rainwater can be stored in a reservoir to drive generators under a dam (but in times of low rainfall these power stations are less effective); high and low tides near the sea can also generate electricity using a dam: 
            <figure>

            <figcaption><em>A tidal power generator works cyclically with the rising and falling tide</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br/>
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/17_1_3-compressed.png" alt="" >
            <figcaption><em>A hydroelectric power station harnesses the enormous power of millions of gallons of water falling under gravity</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear power</strong>: Uranium atoms are unstable – they split, releasing heat. The energy from these <strong>fission</strong> reactions heats water to make steam to drive turbines. The uranium fuel eventually will split no more and leaves behind dangerous waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Geothermal power</strong>: Rocks deep beneath the ground (often in volcanic areas) become hot from radioactive substances. Cold water pumped down to the rock turns to steam; this is carried back up to drive turbines.</li>
        <li><strong>Start-up times</strong> (AQA): store extra energy in an efficient way. Water is sent to a higher reservoir using cheap off-peak energy. It can then be used to produce normal hydroelectricity when demand is high.</li>
        <li>Electricity companies therefore use a combination of different power sources at different times of day to meet peaks and troughs in demand, and to try to achieve efficiencies. For example, gas-powered stations can be used for peak supply because of their fast start-up times.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, electricity generation and distribution as a whole is not especially efficient, even today:
