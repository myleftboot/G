	<h2 id="link1">New ways of extracting metals</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>Ores rich in metals that are useful to us are becoming scarce. For example, it is increasingly difficult to find new sources of copper ores that are <em>rich</em> in copper, even though copper is a major part of the Earth’s crust.</li> 
         
         <li>Mining for metal ores also has considerable environmental impacts. New methods of metal extraction are therefore being developed.

            </figure>
        </li>

         <li><strong>Phytomining copper</strong>: This new technique extracts copper from plants. Some plants are good at absorbing copper from  <em>low-grade </em>copper ores. They may be grown on heaps containing this ore type. They are then burned. Copper is extracted from the resulting ash by electrolysis.</li>   
              
         <li><strong>Bioleaching copper</strong>: Another new (but very slow) technology uses bacteria to produce solutions called leachates, which contain copper compounds. As with phytomining the bacteria feed on <em>low-grade</em> copper ores. Electrolysis is used to extract the copper metal from the leachate.</li>       
                  
                      
    </ul>
	

	<h2 id="link2">More on alloys</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li><strong>Atomic structure of alloys</strong>: Pure metals like iron tend to be easily shaped, but are too soft for practical use – their atomic layers slide too easily over each other:

            </figure>
         </li> 
                        
         <li>However, when mixed with small amounts of carbon to make steel, iron becomes much stronger – the layers now find it more difficult to slide over each other:
            <figure>
				<img src="assets/images/" alt="" >
            </figure>
         </li>                              
                                                      
         <li>The same principle applies to other alloys. For example, wedding rings are often made of a gold alloy, e.g. gold mixed with copper. The small percentage of added copper strengthens the ring for everyday use.</li>
         
          <li>Edexcel: Gold of 100% purity is called <strong>24-carat gold</strong>; at 75% purity it is 18-carat gold, and so on, in direct proportion to the other metals added</li>

          <li>Edexcel: Similarly, the <strong>fineness of gold</strong> is a proportional measure of its purity, in parts per thousand. For example, gold at a fineness of 960 is 96% pure – approximately 23&nbsp;carats.</li>
          
          <li>Edexcel: So called <strong>‘smart’ alloys</strong>, also called shape-memory alloys, are being developed for new and amazing uses. One example is nitinol, a nickel-titanium alloy. Its shape can be altered when cooled; its original shape returns when it is warmed up.</li>
          
          <li>Edexcel: Tiny nitinol meshed tubes called <strong>stents</strong> can be used to unblock arteries: the tube is cooled, squashed and inserted into the artery. Once the stent is at the blocked position, the body’s heat helps it to expand:

	<h2 id="link3">Recycling metals</h2>
	<ul>
          <li>Ever increasing percentages of metals are being recycled. The amount being recycled depends on all of us as individuals, businesses and governments.</li>
          
          <li>For example, we can separate out metals like drinks cans and dispose of them at a collection point or as separate rubbish; or, we may simply mix them with other waste that ends up in a landfill site (<em>see</em> Life Cycle Assessment, Section 10.3).</li>
          
          <li>Advantages and disadvantages of recycling metals:
