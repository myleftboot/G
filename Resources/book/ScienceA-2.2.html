	<h2 id="link1">Hormones</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Special <strong>glands</strong> in the body produce chemicals called <strong>hormones</strong>. They are released by the glands into the bloodstream and transported to other parts of the body.</li>
        <li>Hormones control many of the processes that occur in cells and organs

	<h2 id="link2">The menstrual cycle</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>The <strong>menstrual cycle</strong> in women lasts about 28 days. Once a month an egg is released by one of the ovaries. It travels down the fallopian tube and the lining of the womb gets thicker.</li>                
         <li>If the egg is fertilised by a sperm, it embeds itself in the thickened lining of the womb. The woman is pregnant.</li>
         <li>If the egg is not fertilised, the womb lining and the dead egg are flushed out of the body. This part of the cycle is the monthly period or bleed.

	</ul>
 
	
	<h2 id="link3">Hormones and the menstrual cycle</h2>
	<ul>
       <li>The menstrual cycle is controlled by several different hormones. They work together.</li>
        <li>The <strong>pituitary gland</strong> in the brain releases <strong>follicle stimulating hormone</strong>(<strong>FSH</strong>). This causes one or more eggs in the ovaries to mature.</li>
        <li>FSH also causes the ovaries to produce and secrete another hormone, <strong>oestrogen</strong>. Oestrogen stimulates the lining of the womb to become thicker.</li>
        <li>The oestrogen also acts on the pituitary gland, slowing down production of FSH and stimulating production of another hormone, <strong>luteinising hormone</strong> (<strong>LH</strong>). LH acts on the ovaries. It stimulates the ovary to release a mature egg.

    </ul>
	
    <h2 id="link4">Oral contraceptives</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Contraception means preventing pregnancy (birth control). An <strong>oral contraceptive</strong> contraceptive is a pill that contains female hormones. These hormones inhibit production of FSH by the pituitary gland. This prevents eggs in the ovaries from maturing.</li>
       <li>The first oral contraceptive pills contained a lot of oestrogen and often had bad side effects. Newer contraceptives contain oestrogen plus another hormone, progesterone, and have fewer side effects.</li>
       <li>Pills containing only progesterone have the lowest risk of side effects, but may not work so well.</li>
                
    </ul>    
    
    <h2 id="link5">Fertility treatment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes it is difficult for a woman to become pregnant. This may be because her body does not produce enough FSH.</li>
        <li>A ‘fertility drug’ contains artificial FSH. This stimulates the eggs in the ovaries to mature. It also increases oestrogen production by the ovaries.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the problem is caused by blocked or damaged fallopian tubes: <br/>even though mature eggs are released, they do not reach the womb. <strong>In vitro fertilisation</strong> (<strong>IVF</strong>) may help:
            <ol>
                <li>The woman is given a fertility drug containing FSH and LH. This causes several eggs to mature at the same time.</li>
                <li>The mature eggs are removed from the ovary. They are mixed in a Petri dish with sperm collected from the father. Fertilisation occurs</li>
                <li>The fertilised eggs develop into embryos.</li>
                <li>When the embryos have become tiny balls of cells, one or two are put directly into the woman’s uterus (womb), where they may develop into a baby.</li>
            </ol>

        </li>
        <li>IVF is expensive, and it may take several attempts before a pregnancy results, if at all. But it has helped many otherwise childless couples to have children.</li>
                
    </ul>
